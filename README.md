This project reduces food waste and supports the homeless community by connecting surplus food with those who need it most. 33% of all food produced globally is lost or waste. Food waste in cities contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Feeding the unhoused with surplus food could help address two urban challenges simultaneously.
Here are the instructions to build and run the project.
1. Sync the repository Urban-Food-Share.
2. Go into the project directory.
3. Run "npm install" via the terminal to install all relevant dependencies.
4. Run "npm run dev" from the same folder to receive the service url.
5. Copy the url and paste it into the browser's address bar.
6. Once the website opens, add single ingredients one by one before clicking the "plus" button. Then, proceed by clicking the "Click Here to Donate Button."
7. After that, you will get to another form. Once done, check that the stats at the top of the page are updated.
